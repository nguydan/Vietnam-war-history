    <h2>About the Vietnam War</h2>
    <p>
      The Vietnam War was not a single, isolated conflict but a layered struggle shaped by
      colonialism, nationalism, Cold War ideology, and internal Vietnamese divisions.
      What began as a fight for independence from French colonial rule gradually evolved
      into one of the most complex and controversial wars of the twentieth century.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the Vietnamese people, the conflict spanned decades and involved competing visions
      for the nation’s future. For the United States and its allies, Vietnam became a focal
      point of global containment strategy against communism. These overlapping objectives
      transformed a regional struggle into an international war with far-reaching political,
      social, and human consequences.

  <!-- ===== Background & Origins (Pre-1945) ===== -->
  <section id="background">
    <h2>Background and Origins</h2>
    <p>
      The Vietnam War originated from decades of colonial rule, nationalist resistance,
      and global power shifts following World War II. Vietnam had been part of French
      Indochina since the late 19th century, where colonial authorities exploited land,
      labor, and resources while suppressing political self-determination.
    </p>
    <p>
      During World War II, Japan occupied Vietnam, weakening French control.
      Vietnamese nationalist groups—most notably the Viet Minh, led by Hồ Chí Minh—
      organized resistance movements. Hồ Chí Minh blended nationalism with communist
      ideology, prioritizing independence over ideology in the early years.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1945, following Japan’s surrender, Hồ Chí Minh declared Vietnamese independence.
      However, France attempted to reassert colonial authority, setting the stage for
      armed conflict.

  <!-- ===== Geneva Accords & Division (1954) ===== -->
  <section id="geneva">
    <h2>The Geneva Accords and Division of Vietnam</h2>
    <p>
      The 1954 Geneva Accords ended the First Indochina War after the French defeat at
      Điện Biên Phủ. Vietnam was temporarily divided along the 17th parallel, with the
      communist-led North and the Western-backed South.
    </p>
    <p>
      This division was not intended to be permanent. Nationwide elections were scheduled
      for 1956 to reunify the country. However, the South Vietnamese government—supported
      by the United States—refused to participate, fearing a communist victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The United States did not sign the Geneva Accords, marking the beginning of deeper
      American involvement in Vietnam’s internal conflict.

  <!-- ===== Civilian Impact & Human Cost ===== -->
  <section id="civilian-impact">
    <h2>Civilian Impact and Human Cost</h2>
    <p>
      The Vietnam War inflicted immense suffering on civilians. Villages were displaced,
      farmland was destroyed, and millions were forced to flee combat zones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chemical defoliants such as Agent Orange caused long-term environmental damage and
      health effects that persist today. Unexploded ordnance continues to threaten lives
      decades after the war’s end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Estimates suggest that over two million Vietnamese civilians lost their lives,
      making the war one of the most devastating conflicts of the 20th century.
